## Applied machine learning models to estimate material to adsorb CO<sub>2</sub>


- Conducted comprehensive research on the most used materials in CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption based on scientific literature.

- Utilized CRISP-DM methodology for structured and effective project execution.

- Developed and optimized machine learning models, including Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, to predict suitable materials for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption.

- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and employed random search and stratified K-Fold cross-validation techniques to optimize hyperparameters and validate models.

- Achieved significant performance metrics, with a recall of 0.87 and precision of 0.89, surpassing predefined success criteria.

- Visualized and interpreted model results using SHAP and Shapash to enhance transparency and explainability.

- Identified 'CO2_uptake' as a key feature influencing model predictions, demonstrating its importance in the material selection process for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption.

- Emphasized the need for further model refinement and enhancement, particularly through increasing minority class records to improve reliability.
